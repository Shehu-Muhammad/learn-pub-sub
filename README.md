# Learn Pub/Sub (My Progress)

This repository contains **my personal code and notes** while following along with the  
[Boot.dev Learn Pub/Sub course](https://github.com/bootdotdev/learn-pub-sub-starter).

## 🎯 Purpose
I’m using this repo to:
- Practice `git add`, `commit`, and `push`
- Track my learning progress
- Customize and experiment with the code on my own

## 🧠 Credits
Starter code from [Boot.dev’s Learn Pub/Sub Starter](https://github.com/bootdotdev/learn-pub-sub-starter).  
All modifications and commits in this repo are my own work for learning purposes.
